# Step-by-Step: GitHub Repository Setup

## STEP 1: Create GitHub Repository

### 1.1 Go to GitHub
1. Open your browser and go to: **https://github.com**
2. Sign in to your account (or create one if you don't have it)

### 1.2 Create New Repository
1. Click the **"+"** icon in the top-right corner
2. Select **"New repository"**

### 1.3 Fill Repository Details
- **Repository name:** `shift-scheduler-app` (or any name you prefer)
- **Description:** (optional) "Shift Scheduler Application"
- **Visibility:** Select **"Private"** ✅
- **DO NOT** check "Add a README file"
- **DO NOT** check "Add .gitignore" (we already have one)
- **DO NOT** check "Choose a license"

4. Click **"Create repository"**

### 1.4 Copy Repository URL
After creating, GitHub will show you a page with setup instructions. 
**Copy the repository URL** - it will look like:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/shift-scheduler-app.git
```

**Keep this URL handy - you'll need it in the next step!**
